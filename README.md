# Overview

Book analysis progect to analyse how different factors effect the ratings of a book. 
This was used to further explore Python and learn how to use Pandas to analyse data. 
I enjoy reading and thought it would be a fun way to bring reading into my software development learning 
while better understanding and learning how to use new tools such as pandas

# Development Environment

Python and Pandas were used to write the code and create the graphs.
